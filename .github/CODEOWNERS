# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies specified file types, only that owner will be
# requested for a review, not the global owner(s).

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
