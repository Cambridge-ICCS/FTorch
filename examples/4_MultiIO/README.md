# Example 4 - Multiple inputs and multiple outputs

This example revisits the SimpleNet example (again) and demonstrates how to run
a variant of it -- MultiIONet -- for which the 'net' has multiple input tensors
and multiple output tensors.

## Description

A variant of the `simplenet.py` Python file from the first example appears here:
`multiionet.py`. In this case, it defines a simple PyTorch network that takes
*two* input vectors $a$ and $b$ of length 4, concatenates them, and then
multiplies the concatenated vector by the Kronecker product of
$\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ with the $2\times2$ identity
matrix. This has the effect of scaling the first half of the vector by 2 and the
second half by 3. The output is then split into two components. That is, we have
$$
    \begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix}=
    \begin{bmatrix} 2I \\ & 3I \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}=
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are inputs and $c$ and $d$ are outputs.

The same `pt2ts.py` tool as in the previous examples is used to save the
network to TorchScript. Again, a series of files `multiionet_infer_<LANG>` then
bind from other languages to run the TorchScript model in inference mode.

## Dependencies

To run this example requires:

- CMake
- FTorch (installed as described in the main package)
- Python 3

## Running

To run this example install FTorch as described in the main documentation. Then
from this directory create a virtual environment and install the necessary
Python modules:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can check everything is working by running `multiionet.py`:
```
python3 multiionet.py
```
This defines the network and runs it with input tensors [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0] and
[0.0, -1.0, -2.0, -3.0] to produce the result:
```
(tensor([0., 2., 4., 6.]), tensor([ 0., -3., -6., -9.]))
```

To save the MultiIONet model to TorchScript, run the modified version of the
`pt2ts.py` tool:
```
python3 pt2ts.py
```
which will generate `saved_multiio_model_cpu.pt` - the TorchScript instance of
the network.

You can check everything is working by running the `multiionet_infer_python.py`
script. This reads the model in from the TorchScript file and runs it with the
same inputs as above. The result should again be:
```
(tensor([0., 2., 4., 6.]), tensor([ 0., -3., -6., -9.]))
```

At this point we no longer require Python, so can deactivate the virtual
environment:
```
deactivate
```

To call the saved MultiIONet model from Fortran we need to compile the
`multiionet_infer_fortran.f90` file. This can be done using the included
`CMakeLists.txt` as follows:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path/to/your/installation/of/library/> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

To run the compiled code calling the saved MultiIONet TorchScript from Fortran,
run the executable with an argument of the saved model file:
```
./multiionet_infer_fortran ../saved_multiio_model_cpu.pt
```
This runs the model with the same inputs as above and should produce the output:
```
   0.00000000       2.00000000       4.00000000       6.00000000    
   0.00000000      -3.00000000      -6.00000000      -9.00000000
```
