## [Unreleased](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD)

### Added

- Intel-ifx and Intel-ifort CI and GCC v9-13 CI. Intel CI builds OpenMPI from source to accomodate MPI integration tests [#438](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/438)
- Expose tensor strides via `get_stride` method [#416](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/416)
- Remove `UNIX` preprocessor variable that selected the  right C-integer type for 64bit int. Use `int64_t` instead [#416](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/416)
- A new cmake option `MULTI_GPU` to control the build of multi GPU integration tests in [#410](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/410)
- Support for AMD GPU backends (HIP) provided in
  [#385](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/385) and
  [#388](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/388).
- `requires_grad` property hooked up to `torch_tensor` in [#288](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/288)
- MPI example added in [#270](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/270)
- Changelog file and guidance for versioning added in [#313](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/313)
- A new tensor manipulation demo was introduced in [#291](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/291).
- Backpropagation implemented with `torch_tensor_backward` and
  `torch_tensor_get_gradient` in [#286](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/286)
- Zeroing of gradients associated with a tensor implemented in
  [#341](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/341).
- Exposed `retain_graph` argument for `torch_tensor_backward` in
  [#342](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/342).
- Implemented `torch_tensor_zero` and class method alias in
  [#338](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/338).
- Provided interface for `torch_tensor_from_array` with default layout in
  [#348](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/348).
- Overload taking sum and mean of tensors in
  [#344](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/344).

### Changed

- Intel CI now uses Intel oneAPI MPI instead of OpenMPI built with Intel compilers [#449](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/449)
- FTorch library (`libftorch.so`) produced by cmake installation now has `RUNPATH` that contains path to Torch library directory. Downstream targets linking against FTorch can now find the Torch dependency automatically and will compile successfully [#437](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/437).
- In all `CMakeLists.txt` where `find_package(FTorch)` was present, now using `REQUIRE` if not building tests to stop the cmake configuation process early for users who only wish to build examples in [#434](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/434)
- fortitude dependency version increased to 0.7.0
- Examples reordered to be more logical in [#317](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/317)
- scalar multiplication/division of tensors reworked to require the scalar to first be mapped to a `torch_tensor` in [#289](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/289)
- The unit tests for constructing and destroying tensors were separated out in
  [#319](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/319)
- Demo numbers were bumped to account for new demo in
  [#291](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/291).
- Use interface for `torch_tensor_from_array` with default layout in tests and
  examples in [#348](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/348).
- Error handling in `ctorch.cpp` improved in [#347](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pull/347).

### Removed

- Windows CI disabled until GitHub runner issues resolved in [50ea6d7](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/commit/50ea6d78d79ebe638ebe597e745c015549f12a61)
