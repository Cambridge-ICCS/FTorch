## FTorch Installation & Build

This section covers how to build and install FTorch on various platforms.

FTorch is built and installed using the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system.
Guidance for doing this can be found on the
[General Installation](|page|/installation/general.html) page, and should be sufficient
for most users, though further pages contain additional details for specific systems,
architectures, and configurations.
