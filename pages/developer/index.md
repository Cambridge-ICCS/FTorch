FTorch is an open-source project we appreciate any contributions or collaborations from
users that extended the functionality.
If you have done something but don't know where to start with open-source contributions
please get in touch![^1]

[^1]: _Our preferred method of contact is via Github issues and discussions,
but if you are unfamiliar with this you can [email ICCS](mailto:jwa34@cam.ac.uk)
asking for the FTorch developers._

For bugs, feature requests, and clear suggestions for improvement please
[open an issue](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/issues/new/choose).

If you have built something that would be useful to others, or can
address an [open issue](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/issues), please
[fork the repository](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/fork) and open a
[pull request](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pulls).

#### Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in the FTorch project, and in particular in the
issue tracker, pull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other
people with respect and, more generally, to follow the guidelines articulated in the
